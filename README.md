<h3>...oh sorry for yelling, i'm KylomaskGamer! (He/Him)</h3>

A silly little game dev from a wild place called maple land.

I like making silly things in my silly little laptop, both in frontend and backend (but i do more frontend than backend).

I also moderate multiple discord servers (but most of them have less than 50 people).

I also like being <b>inclusive</b> and <b>empathic</b>, and i am usually nice (except if you are mean to me).

Also did i mention that i do pixel art and 8 bit music??

What i am working on:
- Breadocalypse (Survive in a crusty apocalypse with the trusty Gun)
- Moddy (On pause, a discord bot for automatically moderating servers)
- Islander (On pause, a discord bot where you explore and fight crabs for now and craft all on discord)
- Joe Simulator: The Abandonned City (Play as Joe and traverse a scawy city ooooo)
- stupid low effort animations ([such as dancing bread videoo](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Z8UIs45rX48))

What i made:
- A (deephearted) Minecraft Survival Series! Telling stories while building stuff, check it out [here!](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDon0yjD0A-HPrn7hUYEXQUejbQ4e57h)
- Techy Bee Studios!
